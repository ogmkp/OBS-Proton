# OBS Proton
A GUI Interface created for interacting with OBS (Open Broardcasting Software) with MIDI Devices. Currently, the only solution that isn't mind numbingly annoying to use its closed source and very limited. So out of pure annoyance, OBS Proton was made. It was originally going to be node-based programming (A bit like scratch or Unreal Engine Blueprints) but that got wayyy too bloated.

## Installation
```bash
# Node.JS v14.x+ is required along with npm v6.x+
$ npm i

$ npm start
```
